# API Samples

This folder stores small, versioned snapshots of third-party agency APIs we integrate with.

Goals:
- Provide stable reference payloads for mapping code.
- Make it easy to diff API shape changes over time.

Conventions:
- One agency per subfolder.
- Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD_<agency>_limit<N>.json`
- Keep samples small (limit 5–20).
