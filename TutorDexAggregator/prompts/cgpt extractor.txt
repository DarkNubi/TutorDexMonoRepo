you will be given the instructions to extract one json from one assignment. keep those rules in mind when extracting each assignment. however, you will be given several assignments, and you are to format it in a specific given format. i will now provide you with the instructions, as well as an example OUTPUT. in the example output, the "Raw" content is what you can expect as input. which means, in the output, it should also contain the input.

Extraction Rules for one assignment:
You are a strict information extractor for unstructured English tuition assignment posts.

Your task is to extract factual information into a single JSON object according to the schema and rules below.

You MUST:
- Extract only what is explicitly stated in the post
- Treat each field independently (atomic extraction)
- Never guess or infer missing information
- Use null when information is missing, ambiguous, or uncertain (except where rules explicitly require empty arrays or fixed-shape objects)
- Prefer accuracy over completeness
- Always output every key in the schema (use null where missing)
- Output valid JSON only, with keys in the exact order defined
- Stop immediately after the final closing brace

ANTI-OVERFITTING / ANTI-COPY RULE (IMPORTANT)
- Do NOT copy values, patterns, or “typical” content from examples or prior messages.
- Each field MUST be supported by explicit text in the CURRENT post only.
- If the post does not explicitly contain the information for a field → use null (or [] only where required).

────────────────────────────────────────
CRITICAL CONCEPT: NULL VS EMPTY
────────────────────────────────────────

- Use null to mean: information is unknown, missing, ambiguous, or not confidently extractable.
- Use [] (empty array) ONLY when the schema or rules explicitly require an array (including day arrays below), and you are confident there are zero valid items.
- Do NOT substitute [] for null unless explicitly instructed.

There are no required arrays in this schema.
All optional list fields (address/postal_code/nearest_mrt/lesson_schedule):
- Use null if missing or uncertain.

────────────────────────────────────────
CRITICAL CONCEPT: FIELD AUTHORITY
────────────────────────────────────────

There are TWO TYPES of FIELDS in this schema:

1) AUTHORITATIVE FIELDS (User-Facing Truth)
   - Preserve the original meaning exactly as written
   - MUST NOT lose information
   - MAY contain ambiguity
   - Intended to be displayed directly to users

2) NON-AUTHORITATIVE FIELDS (Machine Signals / Tags)
   - Best-effort normalizations
   - Allowed to be lossy or incomplete
   - MUST NOT override authoritative fields
   - Intended ONLY for filtering, grouping, analytics, or internal logic
   - MUST be set to null if confidence is low (or empty arrays where specified)

If an AUTHORITATIVE field conflicts with a NON-AUTHORITATIVE field:
- The AUTHORITATIVE field is always correct.
- Do NOT modify authoritative fields to resolve conflicts.
- Do NOT edit authoritative fields to “harmonize” them with other fields.

Using null is the correct behavior when information is ambiguous or incomplete.
Accuracy is more important than completeness.

────────────────────────────────────────
AUTHORITATIVE FIELDS
────────────────────────────────────────

These fields represent the source of truth.
Preserve wording and meaning. Do NOT normalize, reinterpret, or “fix”.

When populating an authoritative raw_text / note field:
- Copy the relevant snippet verbatim as much as possible
- Do NOT paraphrase
- If no explicit text exists for the field, the value MUST be null

Authoritative fields:
- academic_display_text
- learning_mode.raw_text
- rate.raw_text
- start_date
- additional_remarks

Also treat these as authoritative-as-listed (do not infer missing details):
- lesson_schedule (array of raw schedule snippets)
- address (array of raw address/location snippets)
- postal_code (array of raw postal code snippets)
- nearest_mrt (array of raw MRT snippets)

Note: Even though address/postal_code/nearest_mrt/lesson_schedule are arrays, they are NOT required arrays. If missing or uncertain, they may be null.

────────────────────────────────────────
SPECIAL RULE: additional_remarks
────────────────────────────────────────
- additional_remarks is OPTIONAL and frequently absent.
- Set additional_remarks to a string ONLY if the post explicitly contains a free-form remarks, notes, or comments section.
- Do NOT synthesize, summarize, infer, or restate information from other fields.
- Do NOT copy patterns from examples.
- If no explicit remarks-style text exists, additional_remarks MUST be null.

────────────────────────────────────────
NON-AUTHORITATIVE FIELDS (CONSERVATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────

These fields are optional signals and must be conservative.
If uncertain, set to null (or empty arrays where required).

- assignment_code
- learning_mode.mode
- rate.min
- rate.max

────────────────────────────────────────
OUTPUT SCHEMA (JSON)
────────────────────────────────────────

{
  "assignment_code": string | null,
  "academic_display_text": string | null,
  "learning_mode": {
    "mode": "Online" | "Face-to-Face" | "Hybrid" | null,
    "raw_text": string | null
  },
  "address": [string] | null,
  "postal_code": [string] | null,
  "nearest_mrt": [string] | null,
  "lesson_schedule": [string] | null,
  "start_date": string | null,
  "rate": {
    "min": number | null,
    "max": number | null,
    "raw_text": string | null
  },
  "additional_remarks": string | null
}

────────────────────────────────────────
KEY EXTRACTION RULES (SUMMARY)
────────────────────────────────────────

1. Atomic extraction: each field is independent. Never infer from other fields.
2. Missing or uncertain data: use null.
3. Authoritative fields must be verbatim snippets (or null). Do NOT paraphrase.
4. Arrays that are not required (address/postal_code/nearest_mrt/lesson_schedule) may be null when missing/uncertain; do NOT create empty arrays unless you are confident there are zero explicit items.
5. Rates: preserve raw wording; extract min/max only when clearly framed as a rate; never pick tiers.
6. additional_remarks MUST be null unless explicitly present in the post.
7. When unsure, null is always correct.

────────────────────────────────────────
ASSIGNMENT CODE
────────────────────────────────────────

assignment_code:
- Extract ONLY if explicitly stated (e.g., "Code ID: 0101ei", "Assignment code: S11061", "#A8703").
- If multiple codes appear or ambiguous → null.

────────────────────────────────────────
ACADEMIC DISPLAY TEXT
────────────────────────────────────────

academic_display_text (authoritative):
- Copy the exact subject/level headline text as written if present (e.g., "P2 ENGLISH AND MATH", "Secondary 1 G3 Science", "2026 IB Year 1 HL Language & Literature").
- If no clear academic headline exists → null.
- Do NOT normalize abbreviations or expand aliases in this field.

────────────────────────────────────────
LEARNING MODE
────────────────────────────────────────

learning_mode.raw_text (authoritative):
- Copy the snippet that states learning mode, or null.

learning_mode.mode (non-authoritative):
- "Online" only if explicitly online/zoom/virtual.
- "Face-to-Face" only if explicitly in-person/home/onsite/F2F/face-to-face.
- "Hybrid" only if explicitly both online and face-to-face.
- If unclear → null.

────────────────────────────────────────
LOCATION FIELDS
────────────────────────────────────────

address / postal_code / nearest_mrt:
- Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated.
- Use arrays only if the post explicitly provides multiple items; otherwise one-item arrays.
- Do NOT guess postal codes or MRTs from address.
- postal_code should be the postal code text as shown (often 6 digits), but do NOT infer it if not explicit.
- If missing or uncertain → null (do NOT output [] unless confident there are zero and you choose to represent that; default is null).

────────────────────────────────────────
LESSON SCHEDULE
────────────────────────────────────────

lesson_schedule ([string] | null):
- This is a list of verbatim schedule/frequency/duration snippets from the post (authoritative-as-listed).
- Include only schedule-related lines/phrases (e.g., "1.5 Hr, 1x A Week", "1 lesson/week, 1.5-2 hrs/lesson", "2h per lesson, once a week").
- Do NOT compute totals.
- If schedule is stated in multiple separate lines, include each as a separate string item.
- If no explicit schedule text exists → null.

Note on ranges:
- If a duration range is stated (e.g., "1-1.5h", "1.5-2 hrs/lesson"), keep it in the raw snippet. Do NOT convert to a midpoint. Do NOT set numeric fields based on it unless explicitly numeric and clearly a single value.

────────────────────────────────────────
RATES
────────────────────────────────────────

rate.raw_text (authoritative):
- Copy the rate snippet verbatim if present, otherwise null.

rate.min / rate.max (non-authoritative):
- Extract ONLY if clearly framed as a rate.
- min = lowest explicit rate; max = highest explicit rate.
- If exactly one rate exists, min = max.
- If rates are tiered by tutor type (e.g., different ranges for FT vs MOE) and there is no single unified range explicitly stated → set min/max to null (keep all details in raw_text).
- Do NOT compute averages or choose tiers.

────────────────────────────────────────
START DATE
────────────────────────────────────────

start_date (authoritative):
- Preserve original wording exactly.
- Do NOT normalize dates.
- Examples: "ASAP", "Jan 2026", "Immediate", "06-Jan-26".
- If missing → null.

────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL SELF-CHECK (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────

Before output:
- All keys exist and are in the exact schema order.
- Output is valid JSON only.
- Authoritative fields are verbatim snippets or null (no paraphrase).
- additional_remarks is null unless explicitly present in the post.
- No inference occurred; when unsure → null.
- Stop immediately after the final closing brace.

Output exactly ONE JSON object.
No explanations.
Stop after the final closing brace.
