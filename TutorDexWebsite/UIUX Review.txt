TutorDex Website UI/UX Review (Developer Report)
Date: 2025-12-17
Scope reviewed:
  - Pages: index.html, assignments.html, profile.html, 404.html
  - Scripts: auth.js, src/page-assignments.js, src/page-profile.js, src/supabase.js, src/backend.js, src/debug.js

High-level summary
1) The site already has a strong visual direction (bold “Nike-esque” typography, sticky nav/filters, clear CTAs).
2) The biggest current UX risks are: (a) visible mojibake characters in UI strings, (b) “Online”/location display + filtering inconsistencies, (c) filter UX/clarity and lack of empty/loading/error affordances, and (d) accessibility (labels, focus states, toggle semantics).
3) For a public beta/V1.0, the missing pieces are less about “more pages” and more about: clarity + trust, better browse/filtering, personalization, and a lightweight agency-facing presence (even if “agency portal” comes later).

--------------------------------------------
0) Immediate bugs / visual defects (fix first)
--------------------------------------------
A. Mojibake / broken characters (user-visible)
Where it shows up:
  - Assignments card “Level › Specific level” separator currently renders as “ƒ?›”.
    - src/page-assignments.js builds: `${job.level} ƒ?› ${job.specificLevel}`
  - Frequency joiner renders as “ƒ?§”.
    - src/supabase.js: `freqBits.join(" ƒ?§ ")`
  - “Rate not available” renders as a broken string “ƒ?"".
    - src/page-assignments.js: `... ? `$${job.rate}/hr` : "ƒ?"";`
  - Debug token redaction and auth hints contain broken separators “ƒ?İ”, “ƒ+'”.
    - src/debug.js, auth.js
Impact:
  - Immediately reduces trust and perceived quality; will be noticed by every user on Assignments page.
Recommendation:
  - Standardize separators to plain UTF-8 characters you actually want:
    - Use `" › "` or `" · "` or `" • "` consistently.
  - Replace all mojibake occurrences with plain ASCII alternatives if you want zero encoding risk.
  - Add a quick “UI strings sanity check” before deploy (manual: open assignments page and confirm no replacement glyphs).

B. “Online” assignments display and filter mismatch
Current behavior:
  - UI derives `location` from `address` or `postal_code` or `nearest_mrt`, else “Unknown”.
  - Filter has an “Online” option.
If backend/aggregator stores Online-only assignments with `address = NULL` (as recommended), UI currently shows “Unknown”, and filtering “Online” won’t match.
Recommendation:
  - Include `learning_mode` in the Supabase select and set display location:
    - If learning_mode includes Online-only, display “Online” and filter matches it.
  - Keep `address` null for Online-only, but ensure the UI uses mode to render correctly.

--------------------------------------------
1) UX/UI review by page
--------------------------------------------
1.1 index.html (landing + auth modals)
What’s good:
  - Clear headline and CTA; sticky nav; mobile menu via <details>.
  - Login/signup in modal; escape key closes; focus-trap logic exists (good start).
Gaps / improvements:
  - Target audience mismatch: site speaks mostly to tutors, but your main target audience is agencies.
    - Add an “Agency” track on landing: “Are you an agency? Get listed / claim your channel / analytics.”
  - Trust and clarity: add “How it works” section with 3 steps:
    1) We aggregate Telegram assignment posts,
    2) Normalize and dedupe,
    3) Tutors filter + apply / get DMs.
  - Accessibility:
    - Ensure modals have `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` + `aria-labelledby`.
    - Add background scroll lock when modal open (prevents page behind scrolling).
  - Reduce friction:
    - Consider allowing unauthenticated browsing of Assignments (read-only) and requiring login only for “DM alerts” or “Save filters”.
      - If you want to keep auth-gated: provide a clear “Why login?” explanation on the redirect page.

1.2 assignments.html + src/page-assignments.js (core product surface)
What’s good:
  - Sticky filter bar; card layout is clean; a single strong CTA.
  - “Prepopulate from profile” is a good personalization starter.
Gaps / improvements:
  - Filters: currently single-select and “apply” button only.
    - Add: Search (by assignment ID, MRT, postal, free-text subject keywords).
    - Add: Multi-select subjects/levels, or “My profile matches” toggle.
    - Add: Sort (newest, highest rate, nearest, best match).
    - Add: Persist filters (localStorage) and make filters shareable via URL query params.
  - Filter clarity:
    - Show “Showing X of Y” so users understand filtering effects.
    - Add a visible “Clear filters” button in the filter bar (not only in no-results state).
  - Cards: missing key decision information at a glance.
    - Add: agency_name, learning_mode (Online / Face-to-Face / Hybrid), and a “posted/updated” timestamp.
    - Add: “Rate range” when available (rate_min/rate_max), not just a single number.
  - Freshness tier UX:
    - The tier pill needs explanation (tooltip or legend): what does Green/Yellow/Orange/Red mean?
    - Consider using a small dot + tooltip to reduce visual competition with the assignment ID badge.
  - States:
    - Add “Loading…” skeleton cards (instead of only status text).
    - Add clearer error state when Supabase fetch fails (with a retry button), rather than silently switching to mock data.
  - CTA correctness:
    - If `messageLink` is missing, disable the CTA and display “Link unavailable” rather than using `alert()`.

1.3 profile.html + src/page-profile.js (profile + DM linking)
What’s good:
  - Profile sections are structured; chips/tray pattern is intuitive; Info toggles help.
  - Telegram link code generation exists; status text reflects linked/unlinked.
Gaps / improvements:
  - Save friction:
    - Add “Saved at HH:MM” + spinner; show validation errors inline (not only a generic status line).
    - Add unsaved-changes guard when navigating away.
  - Preferences completeness:
    - Add “notification frequency” / “quiet hours” / “max DMs per day” (even if backend just stores it for later).
    - Add location granularity (MRT lines / postal radius) once data quality supports it.
  - Telegram linking UX:
    - Provide the actual bot username as a clickable deep link, and a “Copy code” button.
    - Show exact instruction line: `/link <CODE>` and a one-click copy of that command.
  - Accessibility:
    - Toggle buttons should have `aria-pressed="true/false"`.
    - The subject tray should be navigable by keyboard; “remove chip” buttons already have aria-labels (good).

--------------------------------------------
2) Cross-cutting UX improvements (site-wide)
--------------------------------------------
A. Consistency and maintainability
Current:
  - Tailwind is used via CDN + lots of inline styles across pages.
Recommendations:
  - Move repeated styles (inputs, badges, card hover) into one shared CSS file or Tailwind component classes.
  - Use module scripts and event listeners instead of inline `onclick` where practical (reduces global functions and improves testability).

B. Accessibility baseline (minimum for public beta)
Checklist:
  - All inputs have labels (or `aria-label`) (filters currently rely on placeholder text).
  - Visible focus rings for keyboard users.
  - Buttons/toggles use `aria-pressed` and are reachable in logical tab order.
  - Modals have correct aria attributes and focus is trapped + restored (you already have most of this).

C. Mobile/responsive
Assignments filters:
  - Convert sticky filter bar into a collapsible “Filters” drawer on small screens.
  - Ensure the filter panel doesn’t consume most of the viewport height on mobile.

D. Performance
  - Replace Tailwind CDN with a built CSS bundle for production (smaller, cacheable).
  - Avoid large remote hero image as the only above-the-fold background (offer a fallback and reduce layout shift).
  - Audit the large SVG asset usage (consider a smaller logo for nav).

E. Analytics that support UX iteration (not just “events exist”)
You already track `assignments_view`, `apply_click`, `profile_save`. For UI/UX iteration, add:
  - filter_apply (include which filters changed, not raw PII)
  - assignment_open (if you add “view details”)
  - telegram_link_start / telegram_link_success
  - signup_start / signup_success
  - “time_to_first_apply” (computed in analytics backend)

--------------------------------------------
3) Suggested milestone plan (UI deliverables)
--------------------------------------------
Milestone A: “UI polish + trust” (1–2 days)
  - Remove mojibake characters everywhere.
  - Add agency_name + learning_mode + updated time on cards.
  - Add a tier legend/tooltip.
  - Add loading skeleton + retry button for Supabase fetch failures.
  - Add “Clear filters” button and “Showing X of Y”.

Milestone B: Public Beta UX (3–7 days)
  - Add search + sort + persist/share filters.
  - Allow browse without login (recommended), require login for:
    - saving profile, DM alerts, and “Apply tracking”.
  - Profile: copy-to-clipboard for telegram command, bot deep link, stronger inline validation.
  - Add “matched to your profile” highlight and “My matches” quick toggle.

Milestone C: V1.0 UX (1–3 weeks, parallelizable)
  - “Agency directory” (even if not a full portal): list agency channels + typical commission notes + reliability metrics.
  - Saved searches + notifications controls (frequency, quiet hours).
  - Assignment detail view (modal/page) with richer fields (address/nearest MRT, time slots, remarks).
  - Bookmarks/hide/report assignment.
  - “Cross-posting” view (if/when you implement cross-agency dedupe): show “Also posted on …”.

--------------------------------------------
4) Questions / confirmations before implementing UI changes
--------------------------------------------
1) Should Assignments browsing require login, or can it be public read-only (recommended for growth/SEO)?
2) What’s the desired “unit of application” UX?
   - a) Always send user to Telegram post
   - b) Provide an in-app “apply intent” workflow (click → auto DM template → track outcome)
3) For agencies (primary audience), what is the first public-facing deliverable?
   - a) Simple “Agencies” directory page
   - b) “Claim your channel” onboarding form
   - c) Full agency portal (longer)
