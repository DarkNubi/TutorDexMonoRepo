TutorDex — Internal Strategy v3
Trust → Habit → Intelligence → Flow → Leverage

1. Executive Summary
What this business is really doing
TutorDex is not a marketplace and not a lead generator.
TutorDex is market infrastructure on the tutor side.
It captures tutor attention, converts it into habit, turns habit into behavioural intelligence, and uses that intelligence to re-route application flow away from fragmented agency channels and toward a structured, tutor-controlled interface.
We do not create demand.
We control how demand is perceived, evaluated, and acted on.

What game it is playing
The game is control of the application layer in a fragmented tuition market.i
Agencies compete for supply (tutors).
Tutors suffer from information overload, low trust, and wasted effort.
TutorDex wins by becoming:
The default lens through which tutors see the market


The lowest-effort path from discovery → decision → application


The most trusted surface for determining what is real, fresh, and worth applying to


Once tutors rely on TutorDex for decisions, flow centralisation becomes inevitable.

Why it wins if executed correctly
TutorDex wins because:
Tutor attention is scarce; assignments are abundant

 Scarcity always wins leverage battles.


Trust compounds faster than growth

 Agencies cannot out-trust a neutral tutor-side system.


Cross-agency outcome intelligence is not replicable

 No single agency can see the full market. TutorDex can.


We never force centralisation prematurely

 Control is earned, not demanded.



The single biggest risk
Violating tutor trust before dependence is established.
If TutorDex is perceived as:
Biased


Pay-to-win


Inventing or manipulating listings


Selling tutors out to agencies


…the loop collapses.
There is no recovery path.

2. End State Definition
What the market looks like when TutorDex has won
Tutors do not scan Telegram manually


Tutors do not rely on single agencies


Tutors expect ranked, contextualised listings


Agencies assume TutorDex is part of the pipeline


TutorDex is the default application interface.

Who depends on TutorDex, and how
Tutors
Depend on TutorDex for discovery, filtering, and confidence


Lose efficiency and safety without it


Agencies
Depend on TutorDex for liquidity, responsiveness benchmarks, and structured applicants


Lose fill speed and visibility without it



What would break if TutorDex disappeared
Tutors revert to brute-force scanning


Agencies lose cross-market visibility


Scam rates increase


Application efficiency collapses


That is infrastructure-level dependence.

What TutorDex explicitly does not become
A tuition agency


A demand generator


A price-setting cartel


A black-box recommender with no audit trail


TutorDex remains neutral infrastructure with visible reasoning.

3. Core Thesis & Constraints
Core thesis (operationalised)
Aggregate tutor attention → reduce effort → observe behaviour → accumulate intelligence → improve decisions → centralise flow.

Non-negotiable constraints
Tutor trust is preserved even at revenue cost


Listings are never fabricated


Auditability is always present


Free tier must remain genuinely useful



Explicit trade-offs we accept
Slower monetisation


Lower short-term growth


Hostility from agencies


Higher infra cost per user early



Lines we will not cross
Selling tutor data directly to agencies


Suppressing free users to coerce upgrades


Hiding sources or manipulating listings


Pay-to-win ranking

5. Market Failure & Legitimacy
What is broken today
Fragmentation across channels


Duplicates and bumps


No accountability


No status visibility


No outcome feedback loop



Why incumbents cannot fix it
Agencies only see their own funnel


Incentives reward volume, not quality


No reason to expose reliability



Why TutorDex is allowed to exist
TutorDex:
Does not create demand


Does not hide sources


Reduces scams and spam


Improves tutor outcomes


It is a safety and efficiency layer, not a competitor.

How legitimacy is reinforced continuously
Public audit surface


Visible scoring logic


Fast correction of errors


Clear tutor-first framing



6. Tutor Trust Doctrine
What trust means (concretely)
Listings are real


Status is accurate or honestly unknown


Rankings reflect likelihood, not payment


Data is used to help tutors, not exploit them



How trust is measured
“Already filled” complaint rate


Unsubscribe rate after alerts


Manual scanning fallback reports


Repeat application behaviour



How trust is lost
Fake or stale listings


Pay-to-win suspicion


Hidden manipulation


Excessive spam



Hard rules
Audit layer never removed


Free tier never crippled


Paid does not override validity


One-tap escape always available



Features we would kill to protect trust
Aggressive upsell prompts


Artificial scarcity


Hidden ranking boosts


Dark-pattern notifications

8. Free vs Paid Strategy
Why free must feel powerful
Free is the trust engine and the data engine.
If free feels weak:
Intelligence degrades


Trust collapses


Paid looks coercive



What paid is allowed to improve
Precision


Speed


Workflow


Insight


Not access to reality.

Guardrails
Free always gets real opportunities


Paid never suppresses free below baseline


Paid improves efficiency, not fairness



How monetisation compounds intelligence
Paid users:
Provide higher-resolution behaviour


Stress-test predictions


Improve models for everyone



9. Intelligence Moat
What data is defensible
Cross-agency outcomes


Behavioural preference graphs


Responsiveness benchmarks



How it is accumulated
Passive observation


Explicit outcomes


Longitudinal behaviour



How it is used internally first
Ranking


Matching


Fraud detection



When it is exposed externally
Carefully


Aggregated


Contextualised



Why competitors cannot copy it
They lack:
Cross-agency scope


Behavioural depth


Trust to collect it



10. Agency Counter-Moves & Response Plan
Likely attacks
Obfuscation


Duplication


Pressure on tutors


Legal threats



Early warning signals
Format drift


Complaint spikes


Sudden source loss

15. Final Operating Principles
Trust over revenue


Loop over features


Evidence over opinion


Slow is smooth; smooth is fast


If it doesn’t reinforce the loop, it is deprioritised



TutorDex is not a product.
It is an operating system for tutor decision-making.
