Why? – Identifying Market Gaps 🔍
Market fragmentation
 Tutor assignments are split across many agencies (especially Telegram), forcing tutors to join multiple channels and manually scan.
High noise, low signal
 Duplicates, bumps, end-of-day compilations, inconsistent post formats, and unclear “open/closed” status → time wasted.
Poor matching
 Tutors want “dream assignments” (near home, good rate, good timing), but current discovery is brute force.
No true aggregator today
 Nothing indexes assignments island-wide in one place with usable filtering and notifications.
Hidden inefficiency
 Fragmentation creates mismatch where some agencies have surplus tutors while others have unfilled assignments.

Why – Tutor’s Appeal 🎯
Convenience
 One place to see what’s available across agencies, without joining 10 channels.
Edge / speed
 Personalised “sniper” DMs deliver assignments directly to tutors instead of forcing them to hunt.
Better outcomes
 Higher chance of landing high-quality assignments (nearby, better-paying, suitable level/subject).
Less wasted effort
 Fewer applications to already-filled or irrelevant assignments, especially as status inference improves.

Censorship Strategy 🛡️
Censorship is planned with potential competition in mind.
Initially, TutorDex will be relatively lax with censorship to:
build a large tutor community


accelerate habit and dependence


validate demand and surface real competitors


Once credible competition or scraping behaviour is observed:
selected assignment properties and statistics may be censored


full details will increasingly live in DMs and the website


the main channel becomes a discovery and credibility surface


At this stage, most existing tutors are expected to have already muted the main channel and rely primarily on DMs, preserving tutor value while protecting TutorDex’s data and intelligence moat.

Free vs Paid Philosophy (TutorDex) ⚖️
Core Principle
TutorDex should feel unfairly powerful even when free.
 Payment is for amplification, not access.
If a tutor pays because they are desperate, you failed.
 If a tutor pays because they want the maximum edge, you succeed.
TutorDex gives tutors free access to the entire tuition market and charges only for speed, precision, and intelligence — never for visibility.

Free Tier 🟢
Free tier exists to:
shift tutor behaviour away from agency channels


build habit and dependence


maximise word-of-mouth growth


Free users should regularly think:
 “Why would I ever go back to scanning Telegram channels?”
Free Tier = Market Access + Intelligence Preview
Free users should get:
Aggregated access
 Tutors can see assignments across many agencies in one large Telegram community, with separate topics by level and subject.
Basic filtering
 Subject, level, general location, online vs home.
Free personalised delivery
 Tutors receive DM notifications for matching assignments at no cost.
Limitations may include:
capped number of DMs per day


slight delivery delay (e.g. 5–10 minutes)


broader, less precise matching


optional reminder when daily limit is reached


Market context (light)
 Simple stats such as:
“X assignments matched you in the last 7 days”


“Median rate for this category”


Important:
 The free tier already solves a real pain.
 It is not a crippled demo.

Paid Tier 🔴
Paid tier is not about unlocking assignments.
 Paid tier is about precision, control, and dominance.
Think:
 free = visibility
 paid = advantage
Paid Tier = Precision Advantage
Paid users get:
More precise filtering
tighter location radius (e.g. exact address / distance-based)


stricter rate thresholds


finer subject and level combinations


Higher quality matches
improved ranking of assignments


fewer “almost relevant” notifications


Advanced intelligence
 Examples:
estimated competitiveness (“likely to fill in ~12 minutes”)


rate vs market percentile


historical success rate for similar assignments


Priority delivery
 If two tutors match the same assignment, paid users may receive:
earlier notifications


more consistent delivery


Paid users should feel:
 “I’m not just seeing assignments — I’m seeing only the ones that matter most to me.”

What Should NEVER Be Paywalled 🚫
These are red lines.
Basic aggregation


Source transparency (which agency it came from)


Ability to apply


Access to historical listings (even if delayed)


Receiving assignment notifications at a basic level



Milestones 🧭
Milestone 1 — Aggregation Accuracy
Goal
 TutorDex is trusted as a legitimate source of assignments.
Signals of completion:
aggregation runs reliably every day without manual intervention


tutors see assignments from multiple major agencies in one place, well formatted


duplicates and obvious noise are consistently removed


tutors revisit TutorDex without prompting


Why this matters
 Without credibility, nothing else compounds. This is the “prove it works” phase.

Milestone 2 — Soft Monetisation (Not Forced)
Goal
 Monetisation feels natural, not intrusive.
Signals of completion:
a small subset of tutors voluntarily pay for tighter filtering


no backlash from free users


infrastructure costs are partially offset


Options:
start with “buy me a coffee” (pay-what-you-want)


move to monthly subscriptions


eventually stabilise at fixed monthly pricing



Milestone 3 — Tutor Behaviour Shift
Goal
 Tutors stop actively monitoring other agency channels.
Signals of completion:
tutors mute MindFlex / Nanyang / SmileTutors bots


tutors say: “I’ll just wait for TutorDex to ping me”


engagement happens primarily via DMs and the website


Why this matters
 This is real product–market fit. Tutor attention is the currency.

Milestone 4 — Dependence via Personalisation
Goal
 TutorDex becomes a daily decision tool, not a discovery tool.
Signals of completion:
tutors tweak preferences to optimise matches


tutors rely on stats like match frequency and typical rates


free tier already feels “too good to leave”


Why this matters
 Once dependence forms, switching costs appear even without payments.

Milestone 5 — Intelligence Accumulation
Goal
 TutorDex knows the market better than any single agency.
Signals of completion:
clear insight into underserved subjects and locations


understanding of which time slots fail most


internal dashboards show stable, useful patterns


Why this matters
 This is where TutorDex stops being copyable.

Milestone 6 — Application Flow Centralisation (Power Shift)
Goal
 Applications start flowing through TutorDex.
Signals of completion:
one-click apply is used meaningfully


measurable applications sent per agency and success rates


tutors prefer applying via TutorDex


Why this matters
 This flips leverage from agencies to TutorDex.

Milestone 7 — First Agency Dependence
Goal
 At least one agency becomes measurably dependent on TutorDex.
Signals of completion:
a noticeable percentage of applications originate from TutorDex


agency performance dips when TutorDex traffic pauses


before/after fill-rate graphs are demonstrable


Why this matters
 This is when commissions become inevitable, not forced.

Milestone 8 — Scalable Agency Monetisation (Endgame)
Goal
 Agencies pay TutorDex to access tutor liquidity and intelligence.
Signals of completion:
agencies pay commissions or subscriptions


TutorDex is treated as a partner, not a scraper


losing TutorDex would materially hurt agency operations


Why this matters
 This is the sustainable business.

Final End Goal for TutorDex 🏁
TutorDex becomes the default interface through which tutors interact with the tuition market, shifting behaviour away from manually scanning multiple agency Telegram channels to receiving personalised, intelligent assignment delivery. Tutors primarily engage via Telegram DMs and the TutorDex website, where assignments are filtered, ranked, and contextualised with useful intelligence such as distance, estimated travel time, competitiveness, and market benchmarks. Over time, TutorDex evolves from a simple aggregator into a daily decision tool that helps tutors understand demand, optimise preferences, and secure better assignments faster, while one-click apply routes applications through TutorDex itself, making it the central hub where tutor attention, data, and application flow converge.

Where Money? 💰
TutorDex’s main revenue comes from tuition agencies rather than tutors, by gradually becoming a critical source of tutor liquidity and measurable performance uplift. As applications increasingly flow through TutorDex via one-click apply, TutorDex gains visibility into application volume, fill rates, and speed-to-fill, allowing it to negotiate commissions or per-assignment fees in exchange for continued access to its tutor base. In parallel, TutorDex monetises its unique market intelligence by selling agencies analytics, demand reports, and pricing guidance that directly improve profitability. Tutor payments exist only as a secondary stream, reserved for tutors who want finer control and maximum precision, while the core business is driven by agency dependence on TutorDex’s distribution and data.
