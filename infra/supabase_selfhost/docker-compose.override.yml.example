# Optional hardening: keep Supabase Studio private (localhost-only).
#
# Usage (in the Supabase docker folder):
#   Copy-Item D:\TutorDex\infra\supabase_selfhost\docker-compose.override.yml.example .\docker-compose.override.yml
#   docker compose up -d
#
# Note:
# - Do NOT bind Kong (API gateway) to localhost via compose override on Windows.
#   The official compose already publishes Kong ports, and Docker Compose merges port lists,
#   which can create duplicate bindings like 0.0.0.0:8001 AND 127.0.0.1:8001 and fail with
#   "address already in use".
# - Instead, leave Kong as-is and rely on Windows Firewall + only exposing 80/443 via your reverse proxy.
